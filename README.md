# Tender Date Published 

Many countries have the information on when the tender was published. Having this information in a easy way to access it can have many benefits, for instance, to be able to compute some indicators that will say how many days a potential bidder has to prepare an offer.

To satisfy such use cases, this extension adds a date field to the tender section, in which the publisher can set when the tender was published.

## Example

```json
{
	"tender": {
		"datePublished": "2019-07-23T1:27:10.673000-06:00"
	}
}
```
